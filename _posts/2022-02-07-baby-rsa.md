This was an RSA challenge, but [DiceGang](https://https://dicega.ng/) are always creative and they mixed it up quite a
bit! The general gist is that we are given an RSA encrypted ciphertext whose `e` value is not 
[coprime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprime_integers) with its `phi [(p-1)(q-1)]` value. In RSA, non-coprime `phi`
and `e` don't actually make the encryption non-secure, they make it
[non-invertible](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/12255/in-rsa-why-is-it-important-to-choose-e-so-that-it-is-coprime-to-%CF%86n)
which means we can't *uniquely* decrypt the ciphertext.

## Challenge

We are given two files:

```python
# generate.py
from Crypto.Util.number import getPrime, bytes_to_long, long_to_bytes

def getAnnoyingPrime(nbits, e):
	while True:
		p = getPrime(nbits)
		if (p-1) % e**2 == 0:
			return p

nbits = 128
e = 17

p = getAnnoyingPrime(nbits, e)
q = getAnnoyingPrime(nbits, e)

flag = b"dice{???????????????????????}"

N = p * q
cipher = pow(bytes_to_long(flag), e, N)

print(f"N = {N}")
print(f"e = {e}")
print(f"cipher = {cipher}")
```

```
# data.txt
N = 57996511214023134147551927572747727074259762800050285360155793732008227782157
e = 17
cipher = 19441066986971115501070184268860318480501957407683654861466353590162062492971
```

## RSA Refresher

Recall that RSA is an [asymmetric encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography) scheme that relies
on the fact that factoring is hard. This challenge utilizes so-called *textbook* RSA, which isn't typically used in the
real world. In *textbook* [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_\_(cryptosystem)#Operation), we define a few values:

### RSA Parameters

* `p`: a large prime number (private key component)
* `q`: another large prime number (private key component)
* `n`: `p * q` (public key)
* `phi`: `(p - 1) * (q - 1)`
* `d`: `inv(e, phi)` (The decryption key, derived from the private `p` and `q`)
* `e`: public exponent (usually 3, 17, 65537, but technically can be any prime number)
* `m`: plaintext (in Python, we can use `Crypto.Util.number.bytes_to_long(b"your_message_here")` from `pycrypto`)
* `c`: ciphertext

### RSA Encryption

We encrypt by performing:

`c === m^e (mod n)`

This creates the ciphertext `c`, and is done by the provided script in the line:

`cipher = pow(bytes_to_long(flag), e, N)`

### RSA Decryption

We decrypt by performing:

`c^d === (m^e)^d === m (mod n)`

This creates the plaintext `m` back from the ciphertext.

## Solution

The problem is straightforward RSA, and we know off the bat that we need `d` to be able to have a shot at decrypting
this ciphertext. Luckily for us `n` is in [factordb](http://factordb.com/index.php?query=57996511214023134147551927572747727074259762800050285360155793732008227782157).

### Easy Part

So we find the prime factors of `n` are:

```
p = 172036442175296373253148927105725488217
q = 337117592532677714973555912658569668821
```

We can compute `phi`:

```
phi = (p - 1)(q - 1)
phi = 57996511214023134147551927572747727073750608765342311271929088892243932625120
```

Now, we should ostensibly be able to take:

```
d = inverse(e, phi)
plain = pow(cipher, d, N)
print(plain)
```

and be done, but due to the prime generation function `getAnnoyingPrime` this doesn't work! Why? The modular inverse `d`
actually ends up being `1`! This is where the trick comes in. If we examine the "rules" for RSA, we notice that one of
them is that `1 < e < phi` and `gcd(e, phi) == 1`. The second condition ensures that `e` and `phi` are coprime. If we
do this with our `e` and `phi` however:

```python
gcd(e, phi)
>>> 17
```

So they are actually not coprime, `e` is a factor of `phi`...this is bad! It means that we can't correctly decrypt the
ciphertext...or can we?


### Hard Part

The hard part really comes down to Google. If we search "possible private keys when e and phi not coprime", we'll find
a 2-year old [paper from Microsoft Research](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1059.pdf) that explains an algorithm for
recovering all possible plaintexts for RSA performed in exactly this incorrect way given `phi`. Perfect!

There is an implementation of `Algorithm 1` and `Algorithm 2` given in the paper [online](https://github.com/jvdsn/crypto-attacks/blob/master/attacks/rsa/non_coprime_exponent.py)
but I don't really like their code, so I implement them here.

```python
from itertools import permutations, chain
from sage.all import mod, crt, Integer

from Crypto.Util.number import long_to_bytes

N = 57996511214023134147551927572747727074259762800050285360155793732008227782157
e = 17

# http://factordb.com/index.php?query=57996511214023134147551927572747727074259762800050285360155793732008227782157
p = 172036442175296373253148927105725488217
q = 337117592532677714973555912658569668821
cipher = 19441066986971115501070184268860318480501957407683654861466353590162062492971


# Solution mostly taken from
# https://github.com/danshumow-msft/FixBadRsaEncryption/blob/master/script/RSAOAEPPlaintextSearch.py

for pr, qr in permutations(
    chain(
        mod(cipher, p).nth_root(e, all=True),
        mod(cipher, q).nth_root(e, all=True),
    ),
    2,
):
    print(long_to_bytes(int(crt([Integer(pr), Integer(qr)], [p, q]))))
```

And we can just run: `python3 solve.py | grep dice`

`b'dice{cado-and-sage-say-hello}'`
